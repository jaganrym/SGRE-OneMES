public class SecretRotator
{
    private const string CredentialIdTag = "CredentialId";
    private const string ProviderAddressTag = "ProviderAddress";
    private const string ValidityPeriodDaysTag = "ValidityPeriodDays";
==================================================================================
public class SecretRotator
	• This defines a public class named SecretRotator. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it can contain fields, methods, properties, and other members.
private const string CredentialIdTag = "CredentialId";
	• private: This access modifier means the field is accessible only within the SecretRotator class.
	• const: This keyword indicates that the value of the field is constant and cannot be changed after it is initialized.
	• string: This specifies the data type of the field, which is a string.
	• CredentialIdTag: This is the name of the constant field.
	• "CredentialId": This is the value assigned to the constant field.
private const string ProviderAddressTag = "ProviderAddress";
	• Similar to CredentialIdTag, this defines another constant string field named ProviderAddressTag with the value "ProviderAddress".
private const string ValidityPeriodDaysTag = "ValidityPeriodDays";
	• This defines a third constant string field named ValidityPeriodDaysTag with the value "ValidityPeriodDays".
These constant fields are likely used as keys or tags for identifying specific pieces of information, such as credentials, provider addresses, and validity periods, within the SecretRotator class.

===================================================================================
public static void RotateSecret(ILogger log, string secretName, string keyVaultName)
	• public: This access modifier means the method can be called from outside the class.
	• static: This keyword means the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
	• void: This indicates that the method does not return a value.
	• RotateSecret: This is the name of the method.
	• ILogger log: This parameter is used for logging information. ILogger is an interface from the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace.
	• string secretName: This parameter represents the name of the secret to be rotated.
	• string keyVaultName: This parameter represents the name of the Azure Key Vault.
Method Body
	1. var kvUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net";
		○ This line constructs the URI for the Azure Key Vault by concatenating the keyVaultName with the base URL for Azure Key Vaults.
	2. var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(kvUri), new DefaultAzureCredential());
		○ This line creates a new instance of the SecretClient class, which is used to interact with the Azure Key Vault.
		○ new Uri(kvUri): Converts the kvUri string into a Uri object.
		○ new DefaultAzureCredential(): This provides a default credential for authenticating to Azure services, which can include environment variables, managed identity, and more.
	3. KeyVaultSecret secret = client.GetSecret(secretName);
		○ This line retrieves the secret from the Azure Key Vault using the GetSecret method of the SecretClient class.
		○ secretName: The name of the secret to retrieve.
		○ The retrieved secret is stored in the secret variable of type KeyVaultSecret.
	4. log.LogInformation("Secret Info Retrieved");

        log.LogInformation($"Provider Address: {providerAddress}");
        log.LogInformation($"Credential Id: {credentialId}");
================================================================================================================================================
Retrieving Tag Values
	1. var credentialId = secret.Properties.Tags.ContainsKey(CredentialIdTag) ? secret.Properties.Tags[CredentialIdTag] : "";
		○ This line checks if the Tags dictionary of the secret.Properties contains a key matching CredentialIdTag.
		○ If the key exists, it retrieves the value associated with CredentialIdTag and assigns it to credentialId.
		○ If the key does not exist, it assigns an empty string ("") to credentialId.
	2. var providerAddress = secret.Properties.Tags.ContainsKey(ProviderAddressTag) ? secret.Properties.Tags[ProviderAddressTag] : "";
		○ Similar to the previous line, this checks for the ProviderAddressTag key in the Tags dictionary.
		○ It assigns the value associated with ProviderAddressTag to providerAddress if the key exists, otherwise it assigns an empty string.
	3. var validityPeriodDays = secret.Properties.Tags.ContainsKey(ValidityPeriodDaysTag) ? secret.Properties.Tags[ValidityPeriodDaysTag] : "";
		○ This line checks for the ValidityPeriodDaysTag key in the Tags dictionary.
		○ It assigns the value associated with ValidityPeriodDaysTag to validityPeriodDays if the key exists, otherwise it assigns an empty string.
Logging Information
	1. log.LogInformation($"Provider Address: {providerAddress}");
		○ This line logs the value of providerAddress using the ILogger instance log.
	2. log.LogInformation($"Credential Id: {credentialId}");
		○ This line logs the value of credentialId using the ILogger instance log.
Summary
These lines of code are extracting specific tag values from the secret’s properties and logging them. The use of the ternary operator (? :) ensures that if a tag is not present, a default empty string is used instead.
